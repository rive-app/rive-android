### Source `.riv`/`.rev` File

<!--
Attaching the exported `.riv` file that reproduces the issue is immensely helpful for our team to
identify the problem as fast as possible and fix it.

Please also include the source (`.rev`) by
[downloading a backup](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-backup) from the
editor.

Note: Because GitHub only supports certain file types, use a ZIP archive to upload your `.riv`/
`.rev` files for this issue.

You can also privately share the `.riv`/`.rev` file with us at hello@rive.app.
