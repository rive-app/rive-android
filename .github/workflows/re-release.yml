# Note: The steps below are the same as release.yml, but without bumping the version number.
# It is to be used in the event of a failed release, where we want to attempt publishing again without changing the Git tag and version file.
# Uses GitHub Composite Actions. See the steps in .github/actions for more details.
# Note: We may want to consider GitHub Reusable Workflows instead of Composite Actions in the future.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/avoiding-duplication for the differences.
# Notably the logging visibility may improve by switching.
# Reusable workflows can also view secrets rather than requiring them as inputs.
